Welcome to Thelaron

Thelaron software is used to control the operation of WGS-84 Satellite
System (WSS). In Thelaron, your input data is called a *target*. Targets
are tracked via Thelaron interface with cameras and/or radar.

What You Need to Get Started

Before you start working in Thelaron, you should connect the hardware
equipment you plan to use, such as a keyboard, joystick controller, and
camera(s) to your computer. In case you're not sure about a particular
device, consult the owner's manual or the product website. For more
information, see [Devices Overview](#_Utility_Mode).
